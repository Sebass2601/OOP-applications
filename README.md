This repository contains a structured series of C++ examples demonstrating how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) evolves from simple class definitions to more advanced architectures used in real-world software engineering.

The goal:
Understand OOP step-by-step
See how each concept builds toward more complex programs
Learn how to write scalable, reusable, maintainable C++ code

Each file has its own makefile to start the project using:
